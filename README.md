Nowadays, apps affect all aspects of our life, such as Uber, Twitter, Yelp, etc. These apps make people's life more convenient, improve production efficiency, and provide more choices and possibilities. More importantly, they contain a lot of valuable information worth studying. By mining the information of app store, we would have a deeper understanding of this field to help app developers find business opportunities, make decisions and adjust the app in time. We can also gain some insights about people or society. After researching for this topic, we found that there have been many comprehensive analyses for iOS Apps, but conversely, analysis for Apps in Android, actually the most popular mobile operating system, is not that much, so we choose a dataset focusing on Android Apps market to study.
